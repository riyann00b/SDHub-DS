>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

## 📈 Learning Progress

### 🏅 Completed Sessions
- [x] ✅ **Week 1 (Days 1-5):** Course Orientation, AI/ML Concepts, Python Fundamentals, User Input, Operators, and Strings.
- [x] ✅ **Week 2 (Days 6-9):** Python Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries) and Conditional Programming.
- [x] ✅ **Week 3 (Days 10-14):** Control Flow (Loops), Comprehensions, and Functional Programming (`def`, `*args`, `**kwargs`).
- [x] ✅ **Week 4 (Days 15-17):** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O, and Exception Handling.

### 📊 Current Progress
```progress
Week 1: [██████████] 100% - Python Fundamentals Complete!
Week 2: [██████████] 100% - Data Structures & Conditionals Complete!
Week 3: [██████████] 100% - Control Flow & Functions Complete!
Week 4: [██████....] 60%  - OOP, Files & Error Handling In Progress!
```

**📚 Topics Covered So Far:**
- **Python Paradigms:** Procedural, Functional, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **Core Programming:** Variables, data types, operators, I/O.
- **Data Structures:** In-depth study of Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries.
- **Control Flow:** `if`/`elif`/`else`, `while`/`for` loops, `break`/`continue`/`pass`.
- **Pythonic Code:** List/Dictionary Comprehensions.
- **Functional Programming:** `def`, `return`, scope, `*args`, `**kwargs`, `lambda`, `map`, `reduce`.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** `class`, `__init__`, attributes (`self.x`), methods, and the four pillars: **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction**.
- **File Handling:** The `open()` function, file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`), and the `with` statement for safe file operations.
- **Exception Handling:** Using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to gracefully manage runtime errors like `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, and `FileNotFoundError`.

**🎯 Currently Learning:**
- Building robust programs by combining OOP, File Handling, and Exception Handling.
- Implementing `try...except...finally` for solid user input validation and file I/O operations.
- Preparing to apply these skills to read and process datasets using libraries like Pandas.
