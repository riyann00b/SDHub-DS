Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

<summary><strong>Day 13 - July 17th, 2025: Modularizing Code with Functional Programming</strong></summary>  

**🎯 Session Focus:** Writing reusable, modular, and clean code using functions. [Notes](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=%23) | [Notebook](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=%23)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

- **Functional Programming:** Introduced to the paradigm of building programs by defining and composing functions, promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding style.
    
- **User-Defined Functions:** Mastered the core mechanics:
    
    1. **Definition:** Using the def keyword to create a new function.
        
    2. **Parameters & Arguments:** Understood that parameters are the placeholders in the function definition, and arguments are the actual values passed during the function call.
        
    3. **The return Keyword:** Learned the critical difference between print() (displaying a value) and return (sending a value back to the caller for further use).
        
- **Function Lifecycle Diagram:**

- **Variable Scope:** Differentiated between:
    
    - **Local Scope:** Variables created inside a function; they only exist within that function.
        
    - **Global Scope:** Variables created outside any function; accessible from anywhere in the script.
        
- **Recursive Functions:** Explored the advanced concept of a function that calls itself to solve a problem, using the factorial calculation (n! = n * (n-1)!) as the primary example.
    

**💡 Key Insights:**

- Functions are the most important building blocks for organized and scalable programs. They turn complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.
    
- Capturing a function's output with return is far more powerful than just printing it, as it allows the result to be used in other parts of the program.
    
- A good understanding of local vs. global scope is essential for writing bug-free code and avoiding unintended side effects.
    

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**

- Documented all function exercises and concepts from the notebook.
    
- Refactor the pass/fail and even/odd sorting exercises from Day 11 into callable functions that return the sorted lists.
    
- Write a new function that takes a string and returns a dictionary counting the vowels and consonants.
    
- Read more about the Python global keyword to understand when (and when not) to use it.

<summary><strong>Day 12 - July 16th, 2025: Pythonic Data Manipulation with Comprehensions</strong></summary>  

**🎯 Session Focus:** Refactoring loops into elegant, one-line comprehensions for lists and dictionaries. [Notes](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/12%20Loops%20and%20Comprehensions.md) | [Notebook](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/10%20Loop%20and%20comprehension.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

- **Comprehensions:** Understood that comprehensions are a concise, "Pythonic" way to create lists, dictionaries, or sets from existing iterables, replacing multi-line for loops.
    
- **List Comprehensions - The 3 Core Patterns:**
    
    1. **Simple Mapping:** Apply an expression to every item.
        
        - **Syntax:** [expression for item in iterable]
            
    2. **Filtering:** Include only items that meet a specific condition.
        
        - **Syntax:** [expression for item in iterable if condition]
            
    3. **Conditional Output:** Apply different expressions based on a condition.
        
        - **Syntax:** [val_if_true if condition else val_if_false for item in iterable]
            
- **Dictionary Comprehensions:** Mastered the syntax for creating dictionaries from iterables, specifying a key-value pair for each item.
    
    - **Syntax:** {key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable}
        

**💡 Key Insights:**

- Comprehensions are not just syntactic sugar; they are often more readable and can be faster than their equivalent for loop counterparts.
    
- The placement of the if statement is crucial: at the end for filtering, and at the beginning for conditional output.
    
- These patterns are fundamental to data wrangling with libraries like Pandas, where similar vectorized operations are common.

<summary><strong>Day 11 - July 15th, 2025: Mastering Iteration with `for` Loops</strong></summary>  

**🎯 Session Focus:** Using for loops to iterate over sequences and perform data manipulation. [Notes](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/11%20%20Python%20Loops%20%60while%60%20and%20%60for%60.md) | [Notebook](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/09%20While%20loop%20.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

- **The for Loop:** Understood its primary use for iterating over a known sequence (like a list, string, or tuple).
    
- **Practical Data Manipulation:** Filtered lists of numbers into odd/even, scores into pass/fail, and names based on specific criteria.
    
- **while vs. for Loop:** Distinguished the use cases: while for unknown iteration counts, for for definite collections.
    

**💡 Key Insights:**

- Combining a for loop with an if statement is a powerful pattern for filtering data—a fundamental task in data analysis.

<summary><strong>Day 10 - July 14th, 2025: Control Flow and `while` Loops</strong></summary>  

**🎯 Session Focus:** Moving from sequential to iterative programming using while loops. [Notes](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/10%20Control%20Flow%20with%20while%20%20Loops.md) | [Notebook](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/09%20While%20loop%20.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

- **The while Loop:** Mastered the three-step process: Initialization, Condition, and Update.
    
- **Loop Control Keywords:** Learned how break, continue, and pass alter the loop's flow.
    
- **Practical Applications:** Built a simple password authentication system with a limited number of attempts.
    

**💡 Key Insights:**

- The update step (num += 1) is the most critical part of a while loop to avoid an infinite loop.
