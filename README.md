>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

<summary><strong>📅 Week 2 (July 7th Onwards)</strong></summary>

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 5 - July 7th, 2025: Introduction to Python Strings</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Revising operators and a deep dive into string manipulation. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/05%20Python%20Strings.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **String Definition:** An immutable (unchangeable) sequence of characters.
- **String Creation:** Using single (`'...'`), double (`"..."`), or triple (`'''...'''`) quotes.
- **String Access:**
  - **Indexing:** Grabbing a single character using its position (e.g., `my_name[0]` for the first, `my_name[-1]` for the last).
  - **Slicing:** Extracting a substring using a `[start:end:step]` format.
- **Warm-up Practice:** Solved problems involving type casting and arithmetic operators to solidify previous concepts.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The immutability of strings is a key concept. To "change" a string, you must create a new one.
- Slicing, especially with `[::-1]` to reverse a string, is a powerful and concise feature of Python.
- Negative indexing is extremely convenient for accessing items from the end of a sequence without needing to know its length.

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Consolidate today's notes and practice problems into a clean Jupyter notebook.
- [ ] Explore built-in string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, and `.replace()`.
- [ ] Practice more complex slicing patterns to become fluent.

<summary><strong>📅 Week 1 (July 1-4, 2025)</strong></summary>

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong> Day 4 - July 4th, 2025: User Input and Python Operators </strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Making programs interactive and performing operations. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01%20Foundation/01%20Notes/01%20My%20Notes/04%20User%20Input%20%26%20Operators.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Static vs. Dynamic Values:**
  - **Static:** Hard-coded values in the program.
  - **Dynamic:** Values provided by the user during runtime.
- **`input()` Function:**
  - Used to get dynamic input, always returns a string.
- **Type Casting:**
  - The necessity of converting input strings to numbers using `int()` or `float()`.
- **Python Operators:**
  - Covered the full suite: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Membership, and Identity.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Type casting is non-negotiable when getting numerical input.
- `is` and `==` are not the same; `==` checks value, while `is` checks memory location.

<summary><strong>Day 3 - July 3rd, 2025: Python Fundamentals & Jupyter Mastery</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Hands-on coding and environment setup. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01%20Foundation/01%20Notes/01%20My%20Notes/03%20Python%20Fundamentals%20%26%20Jupyter%20Mastery.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Jupyter Notebook Navigation:** Command Mode vs. Edit Mode and essential shortcuts.
- **Markdown Documentation:** Basics of formatting text and structuring notes.
- **Python Fundamentals:** Variable naming rules and basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Good variable naming is crucial for code readability.
- Jupyter notebooks are perfect for combining code, documentation, and results.

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **AI vs ML vs DL Hierarchy:** Understood the relationship between these fields.
- **Generative AI Applications:** Explored text, image, and code generation.
- **Historical Context:** From Alan Turing to modern AI.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- AI is an interdisciplinary field with a rich history.
- Generative AI is a paradigm shift in human-computer interaction.
