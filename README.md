**🎯 Currently Learning: Week 10 - Introduction to SQL**
- We have officially started the database module, kicking things off with SQL.
- Today's focus was on understanding the core concepts of databases, the structure of SQL, and how to define the schema of a database.
- **Up Next:** Manipulating and querying data with DML and DQL.

## 📝 Today's Learning Overview (September 8th, 2025)

<details open>
<summary><strong>Day 68 - Introduction to SQL & Database Fundamentals</strong></summary>
<br>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Understanding the foundational concepts of databases, the role of SQL as a database language, and learning the first major category of SQL commands: DDL.

**📚 Key Concepts Explored:**

Today marked our transition from BI tools into the world of databases. We covered the "why" and "what" of SQL before writing our first queries.

### 🏛️ 1. Database Fundamentals
- **Data vs. Information:** Data is raw (e.g., 'A', 20), while information is structured and meaningful (e.g., a table row with `Name='A'`, `Age=20`).
- **Structured vs. Unstructured Data:** We learned that SQL databases excel at managing **structured data** (tables with rows and columns), like user profiles. **Unstructured data** (comments, posts, likes) is typically handled by NoSQL databases.
- **DBMS vs. RDBMS:** A Database Management System (DBMS) is the software that manages a database. An RDBMS is a specific type for relational (table-based) databases.

### 🧩 2. The Five Sub-Languages of SQL
SQL isn't just one language; it's a set of sub-languages for different tasks. We broke them down:
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** For defining the database structure. `(CREATE, ALTER, DROP)`
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** For manipulating the data itself. `(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)`
- **DQL (Data Query Language):** For fetching data. `(SELECT)`
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** For managing permissions. `(GRANT, REVOKE)`
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** For managing transactions. `(COMMIT, ROLLBACK)`

### 🏗️ 3. DDL in Practice
We spent the most time on DDL, as it's the first step in building a database.
- **`CREATE`:** Used to build a new database or table.
  ```sql
  -- First, create the database container
  CREATE DATABASE sdhub;
  
  -- Then, select it for use
  USE sdhub;
  
  -- Finally, define the table structure (schema)
  CREATE TABLE student_details (
      Name VARCHAR(15),
      Age INT,
      Gender VARCHAR(1)
  );
  ```
- **`ALTER`:** Modifies an existing table's structure (e.g., adding a new column).
- **`DROP` vs. `TRUNCATE`:** A crucial distinction. `TRUNCATE` deletes all data *inside* a table but keeps the structure. `DROP` deletes the *entire table* permanently.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- **Structure is Everything:** SQL's power comes from its enforced structure, ensuring data consistency.
- **Keywords are not Case-Sensitive:** `SELECT` is the same as `select`, but the convention is to use UPPERCASE for readability.
- **DDL is the Blueprint:** You must build the house (DDL) before you can put things inside it (DML).
