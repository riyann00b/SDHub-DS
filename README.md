## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
Of course! Based on today's notes which clarified the roles of Anaconda, `uv`, and Jupyter, I've updated the **"Tech Stack & Tools"** section.

I've reorganized the categories for better clarity and added an Anaconda badge to visually represent the course's standard environment. The description below the badges now clearly explains the difference between the course standard and your personal, high-speed setup.

Here is the updated section for you to replace in your README:

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

This is the comprehensive toolkit we will be mastering throughout the course, from programming languages to development platforms.

Excellent idea! Adding a badge for Astral/uv will make your personal tool choice much clearer and adds a nice modern touch to your stack.

I've added the Astral/uv badge to the "Development Tools & Platforms" section. Here is the updated **"Tech Stack & Tools"** section for your README.

You are absolutely right! My apologies for using the wrong colors. Thank you for providing the exact hex codes. That level of detail is fantastic.

I have now created a new `uv` badge using the correct brand colors: a background of `#d6ff60` and the logo/text color of `#1e0e26`. It should look much more accurate now.

Here is the updated **"Tech Stack & Tools"** section with the corrected badge.

### Environment Setup

*   **Course Standard:** The course will be taught using the **Anaconda** distribution, an all-in-one platform that bundles Python and key libraries.
*   **My Personal Setup:** As a Linux user, I am opting for **`uv`** by Astral, a high-speed package and environment manager, for a more lightweight and modern workflow.
*   **Primary IDE:** Our main environment for coding, analysis, and projects will be **Jupyter Notebook**, valued for its interactive and documentation-friendly format.

## 📝 Daily Learning Log

### Day 2 - July 2nd, 2025: Diving into AI, ML, & DL
-   **Summary:** Today we moved from the "what" of data science to the "how," covering the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence and its key subsets. We also explored the exciting applications of Generative AI.
-   **Key Concepts Learned:**
    -   **AI vs. ML vs. DL:**
        -   **AI (Artificial Intelligence):** The broad concept of creating intelligent machines.
        -   **ML (Machine Learning):** A subset of AI where machines learn from data to make predictions. Works best with structured data.
        -   **DL (Deep Learning):** A subset of ML that uses deep neural networks to solve complex problems with unstructured data (e.g., images, text).
    -   **Generative AI:** Understood its role in creating new content, with examples like Midjourney (images), Google Veo (video), and ChatGPT (text).
    -   **Historical Context:** Learned about Alan Turing's pivotal work during WWII on the Bombe machine to crack the Enigma code, which laid the philosophical foundation for "thinking machines."
-   **New Terminology:**
    -   **NLP (Natural Language Processing):** Enabling machines to understand human language.
    -   **LLM (Large Language Model):** The core technology behind modern chatbots.
    -   **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** The crucial first step of analyzing and visualizing data.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   Begin setting up my Python environment using `uv`.
    -   Launch Jupyter Notebook and practice basic Markdown formatting.
    -   Review the detailed course roadmap to understand the learning path ahead.

### Day 1 - July 1st, 2025: Course Orientation & The World of Data
-   **Summary:** The official start! We received a comprehensive overview of the Data Science field, the course structure, and career opportunities.
-   **Key Concepts Learned:**
    -   **Data Science** uses inferential statistics and ML to predict future outcomes.
    -   **Data Analysis** uses descriptive statistics to understand past data.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   📖 Review basic statistics concepts.
    -   🐍 Prepare for the first Python fundamentals class.
