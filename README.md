## 📝 Daily Learning Log

#### [Day 1 - July 1st, 2025: Course Orientation & The World of Data](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01-Foundation/notes/Day%20-%201.md)
- **Summary:** Today was the official start of the course! We began with a comprehensive overview of the Data Science field, the course structure, and career opportunities.
- **Key Concepts Learned:**
  - **Data Science vs. Data Analysis:** A crucial distinction was made. **Data Analysis** uses descriptive statistics to understand past data (e.g., "What was our sales total last quarter?"), while **Data Science** uses inferential statistics and ML to predict future outcomes (e.g., "What will our sales be next quarter?").
  - **Statistics is the Backbone:** Understood that Descriptive (summarizing data) and Inferential (making predictions) statistics are fundamental to all data work.
  - **The "What, Why, How":**
    - **What:** The study of data.
    - **Why:** To extract actionable insights.
    - **How:** Using tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.
- **Course Roadmap:**
  1.  **Python:** Core programming fundamentals.
  2.  **Python for Data Science:** Libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).
  3.  **SQL:** Database querying.
  4.  **Machine Learning:** Building predictive models.
- **Action Items for Tomorrow:**
  - 📖 Review basic statistics concepts.
  - 🐍 Prepare for the first Python fundamentals class.
  - 🛠️ Familiarize myself with the names and purposes of Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.

> *"The journey begins! Excited to dive into the core concepts and start coding."*
