**🎯 Currently Learning: Week 10 - SQL `JOIN`s**
- We are mastering how to combine data from multiple tables using `JOIN` clauses.
- Today’s focus was understanding the different types of `JOIN`s (`INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`) and the special-purpose `SELF JOIN`.
- **Up Next:** More complex `JOIN` scenarios and advanced database concepts.

## 📝 Today's Learning Overview

<details open>
<summary><strong>Day 71 (September 11th, 2025) - Mastering SQL JOINs: Connecting Multiple Tables</strong></summary>
<br>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column. This is a fundamental skill for querying relational databases effectively.

**📚 Key Concepts Explored:**

### `JOIN`s vs. Nested Queries
While both can be used to get data from multiple tables, `JOIN`s are almost always more performant. The database query optimizer is highly tuned for `JOIN` operations, making them the industry standard.

### 🧩 The Core `JOIN` Types
We visualized the primary `JOIN` types to understand how they include or exclude data.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph JOIN Operations
        A[Table A]
        B[Table B]
    end

    subgraph Result Sets
        direction LR
        Inner["INNER JOIN<br/>(Common Records)"]
        Left["LEFT JOIN<br/>(All from A + Common)"]
        Right["RIGHT JOIN<br/>(All from B + Common)"]
    end

    A -- "INNER JOIN" --> Inner
    B -- "INNER JOIN" --> Inner
    A -- "LEFT JOIN" --> Left
    B -- " " --> Left
    A -- " " --> Right
    B -- "RIGHT JOIN" --> Right

    style Inner fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32
    style Left fill:#e3f2fd,stroke:#0d47a1
    style Right fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#4a148c
```

### The `SELF JOIN`
A powerful technique where a table is joined to itself. This is essential for querying hierarchical data, like finding an employee's manager in the same table.

**Example:** Fetching student details along with their company role and salary using aliases.
```sql
-- Using aliases 'sd' and 'cm' makes the query cleaner and easier to read
SELECT
    sd.Name,
    sd.Age,
    cm.Role,
    cm.Salary
FROM student_details AS sd
JOIN company AS cm ON sd.Name = cm.Name;
```
**💡 Key Insights:**
- **`JOIN`s are essential:** It's impossible to work with relational databases without mastering `JOIN`s.
- **Aliases are your friend:** Using table aliases (`AS`) is a best practice that dramatically improves query readability.
- **Choose the right `JOIN`:** Understanding the difference between `INNER`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` joins is crucial for getting the exact data you need without errors or `NULL` values where you don't expect them.
