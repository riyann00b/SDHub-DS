>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

<summary><strong>Day 11 - July 15th, 2025: Mastering Iteration with `for` Loops</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Using `for` loops to iterate over sequences and perform data manipulation. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/11%20%20Python%20Loops%20%60while%60%20and%20%60for%60.md) | [Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/09%20While%20loop%20.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**, using diagrams and flowcharts to make the concepts easy to understand.

- **The `for` Loop:** Understood its primary use for iterating over a known sequence (like a list, string, or tuple). It simplifies iteration by automatically managing the counter variable.
- **Syntax and Flow:** `for item in collection:`. The loop runs once for each item in the collection.
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Start] --> B(For each item in collection);
      B -- More items --> C[Execute code block for the item];
      C --> B;
      B -- No more items --> D[End];
  ```
- **Practical Data Manipulation:**
  - Iterated through a list of numbers to identify and separate them into `odd` and `even` lists.
  - Processed a list of student scores to filter them into `pass` and `fail` categories.
  - Filtered a list of names based on specific criteria (e.g., starting with a certain letter).
- **`while` vs. `for` Loop:**
  - **`while`:** Best when the number of iterations is unknown (e.g., waiting for user input).
  - **`for`:** Best when you have a definite collection to iterate through.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The `for` loop is the most "Pythonic" way to handle iteration over collections. It's more concise and less error-prone than a `while` loop with a manual counter.
- Combining a `for` loop with an `if` statement is a powerful pattern for filtering data—a fundamental task in data analysis.
- The ability to create new lists based on conditions within a loop (like the pass/fail example) is a core skill for data preparation and transformation.

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Completed and documented all `for` loop exercises from the notebook.
- [ ] Explore **list comprehensions**, a more advanced and efficient way to create lists from `for` loops (e.g., `evens = [i for i in li if i % 2 == 0]`).
- [ ] Practice with **nested loops** (a loop inside another loop) to solve more complex problems, like working with 2D lists (matrices).

<summary><strong>Day 10 - July 14th, 2025: Control Flow and `while` Loops</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Moving from sequential to iterative programming using `while` loops. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/10%20Control%20Flow%20with%20while%20%20Loops.md) | [Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/09%20While%20loop%20.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Introduction to Loops:** Understood why loops are essential for avoiding redundant code.
- **The `while` Loop:** Mastered the core three-step process:
  1.  **Initialization:** Setting up a counter (`num = 1`).
  2.  **Condition:** The test that determines if the loop continues (`while num <= 10:`).
  3.  **Operation/Update:** Modifying the counter to progress towards the exit condition (`num += 1`).
- **Loop Control Keywords:** Learned how `break` (stop), `continue` (skip), and `pass` (do nothing) alter the loop's flow.
- **Practical Applications:** Built a simple password authentication system with a limited number of attempts, demonstrating the power of combining `while True`, `if`, and `break`.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The update step (`num += 1`) is the most critical part of a `while` loop. Forgetting it leads to an infinite loop.
- A `while True` loop combined with `break` is a standard pattern for creating programs that run until a specific exit condition is met inside the loop.
- Combining loops and conditionals is the foundational skill for building almost any complex program logic.

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 8 & 9 - July 10-11, 2025: Conditional Programming Mastery</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Building complex decision-making logic in Python. [Notes 8](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/08%20Revision%20%26%20Conditional%20Programming.md) | [Notes 9](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/09%20Conditional%20Logic.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **`if-elif-else` Chains:** Mastered the flow for handling multiple, mutually exclusive conditions.
- **Nested `if` Statements:** Understood how to create decisions within decisions.
- **The `in` Operator:** Used this powerful keyword to check for membership within a list.
- **Ternary Operator:** Practiced the concise one-line `if-else` syntax.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Nested conditions are the key to building programs that react to a sequence of user inputs.
- The ternary operator is elegant for simple choices but should be avoided for complex logic to maintain readability.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 7 - July 9th, 2025: Sets and Dictionaries</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Understanding and implementing Python's powerful key-value and unique-item collections. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/07%20Sets%20and%20Dictionaries.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Sets:** Unordered collections with **no duplicate elements**. Mastered `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.union()`, etc.
- **Dictionaries:** Ordered collections of **key-value pairs**. Practiced CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Sets are incredibly efficient for removing duplicates from a list (`list(set(my_list))`).
- Dictionaries are the foundation for more complex data structures like JSON, making them extremely important.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 6 - July 8th, 2025: Lists and Tuples</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Deep dive into Python's sequence data types. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/06_Lists_and_Tuples.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Lists:** Ordered, **mutable** (changeable) collections.
- **Tuples:** Ordered, **immutable** (unchangeable) collections.
- **Indexing and Slicing:** Reinforced the `[start:stop:step]` syntax.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The choice between a list and a tuple depends entirely on whether you need to modify the data after creation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 5 - July 7th, 2025: Introduction to Python Strings</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Revising operators and a deep dive into string manipulation. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/05_Python_Strings.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **String Definition:** An immutable sequence of characters.
- **String Access:** Indexing and Slicing (`[start:end:step]`).

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The immutability of strings is a key concept. To "change" a string, you must create a new one.
- Slicing, especially with `[::-1]` to reverse a string, is a powerful and concise feature.
