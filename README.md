> [!NOTE]
> ### Course Setup vs. My Setup
> *   **Python Environment:**
>     *   **Course:** `Windows` + `Anaconda Navigator` + `Jupyter Notebook`.
>     *   **My Setup:** `CachyOS (Arch Linux)` + `uv` (a fast Python package manager) + `Jupyter Notebook`. This gives me a lightweight, high-performance, and Linux-native workflow.
> *   **Database Environment:**
>     *   **Course:** `MySQL` + `MySQL Workbench`.
>     *   **My Setup:** `MariaDB` (a community-driven fork of MySQL) + `JetBrains DataGrip`.

**🎯 Currently Learning: Week 10 - Advanced SQL Queries**
- We've moved beyond basic DDL and are now focusing on powerful DQL techniques.
- Today's focus was on aggregating data with `GROUP BY`, filtering groups with `HAVING`, and using nested queries (subqueries) to solve complex problems.
- **Up Next:** Database `JOIN`s and understanding table relationships.

## 📝 Today's Learning Overview

<details open>
<summary><strong>Day 70 (September 10th, 2025) - Advanced Queries: Aggregation, Grouping, and Subqueries</strong></summary>
<br>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Mastering advanced data retrieval with `GROUP BY`, filtering with `HAVING`, and constructing powerful nested queries (subqueries).

**📚 Key Concepts Explored:**

### 📊 The Anatomy of a SELECT Query
A `SELECT` statement has several clauses that are processed in a specific logical order, which is different from how we write them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### ✍️ Lexical Order vs. Logical Order
> *   **Lexical Order** is how you *write* the query (`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`...).
> *   **Logical Order** is how the database *executes* the query (`FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`...).

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[1: FROM] --> B[2: WHERE]
    B --> C[3: GROUP BY]
    C --> D[4: HAVING]
    D --> E[5: SELECT]
    E --> F[6: ORDER BY]
    F --> G[7: LIMIT]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe,stroke:#01579b,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#4a148c,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e8f5e8,stroke:#1b5e20,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#e65100,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#880e4f,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#f1f8e9,stroke:#33691e,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#fff8e1,stroke:#f57f17,stroke-width:2px
```

### Filtering: `WHERE` vs. `HAVING`
> [!NOTE]
> ### `WHERE` Filters Rows, `HAVING` Filters Groups
> *   The `WHERE` clause filters individual rows **before** they are grouped.
> *   The `HAVING` clause filters entire groups **after** aggregation has occurred.

### 🧩 Nested Queries (Subqueries)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### The Golden Rule of Subqueries
> The **inner query** executes **first**, and its result is used by the **outer query**.

**Example:** Find all employees whose salary is above the company average.
```sql
-- This query finds records with a salary greater than the overall average
SELECT *
FROM company
WHERE salary > (
    -- This inner query runs first to calculate the average
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM company
);
```
**💡 Key Insights:**
- **Think Like the Database:** Understanding the logical query order is essential for writing efficient queries.
- **Aggregation is Key:** `GROUP BY` is one of the most powerful tools for data analysis.
- **Subqueries for Complex Logic:** When a simple `WHERE` clause isn't enough, subqueries allow for dynamic, multi-step filtering.
