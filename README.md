## 📝 Today's Learning Overview (September 4th, 2025)

<details close>
<summary><strong>Day 66 - Power BI: Page Navigation & Report Sharing</strong></summary>
<br>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Enhancing user experience with interactive navigation and understanding the mechanisms for sharing and securing Power BI reports.

**📚 Key Concepts Explored:**

Today, we transitioned from building the report's backend to focusing on the user-facing experience and collaboration features.

### 🗺️ 1. Interactive Page Navigation
We learned how to create a seamless navigation experience, moving beyond the default page tabs.
- **Method:** You can use any clickable element (button, shape, image), enable its **Action** property in the Format pane, and set the type to **Page navigation**.
- **Destination:** You then select which page the button should link to.
- **Testing:** A key difference between environments:
    - **Power BI Desktop:** `Ctrl + Mouse Click` to activate.
    - **Power BI Service:** A standard single click works after publishing.

### 📤 2. Sharing & Collaboration
Publishing a report is just the first step. The real power comes from sharing it with the right audience securely.
- **Power BI Service:** This is the cloud-based hub for all sharing and collaboration. Reports must be published here from the Desktop app.
- **Access Levels:** We discussed how to control what users can do. The most common are:
    - **View:** For consumers who interact with the report but cannot change it.
    - **Edit:** For collaborators who can modify the report and its underlying dataset.
- **Drillthrough:** An interactive feature (not a security one) that lets users navigate from a high-level data point to a detailed, filtered page for deeper analysis.

### 🔒 3. Row-Level Security (RLS)
This was a critical topic for data governance. RLS ensures that users only see the data they are authorized to see.
- **How it Works:** You create "roles" in Power BI Desktop and apply DAX filter expressions to them (e.g., `[Region] = "North"`).
- **Implementation:** In the Power BI Service, you assign users to these roles. When they open the report, the RLS rules are automatically applied, filtering the data dynamically. This allows a single report to serve multiple users with different access rights.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- **Good UI/UX Matters:** A clean navigation system can make the difference between a good report and a great one.
- **Security is Paramount:** RLS is a non-negotiable feature in enterprise environments. It enables data democratization without compromising confidentiality.
- **Share with Intent:** Always think about the minimum level of permission a user needs. Granting "View" access is often sufficient and much safer than granting "Edit".
