**🎯 Currently Learning: Week 11 - Advanced SQL**
- We've moved beyond `JOIN`s to more powerful analytical tools.
- Today’s focus was on **Window Functions** (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`), **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, and **Views**.
- **Up Next:** Stored Procedures, Triggers, and advanced database optimization techniques.

## 📝 Today's Learning Overview

<details open>
<summary><strong>Day 72 (September 12th, 2025) - Advanced SQL: Window Functions, CTEs & Views</strong></summary>
<br>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Unlocking advanced analytical capabilities in SQL. Today we learned how to perform complex, row-level calculations without collapsing data and how to organize large queries for better readability and reusability.

**📚 Key Concepts Explored:**

### 1. Window Functions (Analytical Functions)
These functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without using `GROUP BY`. This allows us to create rankings and running totals while keeping the original row data intact.

-   **`RANK()`**: Assigns a rank, but skips numbers after ties (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4).
-   **`DENSE_RANK()`**: Assigns a rank with no gaps after ties (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3).
-   **`PARTITION BY`**: A powerful sub-clause that resets the window function's calculation for each specified group (e.g., ranking employees *within each department*).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Ranking Functions"
        A[Salary Data] --> B{OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC)};
        B --> C[RANK()<br>1, 2, 2, 4];
        B --> D[DENSE_RANK()<br>1, 2, 2, 3];
    end
```

### 2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs, defined with the `WITH` clause, create a temporary, named result set. They are essential for breaking down complex logic into readable, sequential steps.

### 3. Views
A View is a stored query that acts like a virtual table. It provides a simplified and secure way to look at data without duplicating the underlying tables. It's excellent for saving and reusing complex queries.

**Example:** Finding the 2nd highest salaried employee in each role using a CTE and `DENSE_RANK()`.
```sql
-- CTE 'rank_table' calculates the rank for each employee within their role
WITH rank_table AS (
    SELECT
        name,
        role,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY role ORDER BY salary DESC) AS r
    FROM
        company
)
-- The final query simply filters the CTE for the 2nd rank
SELECT
    *
FROM
    rank_table
WHERE
    r = 2;
```
**💡 Key Insights:**
- **Window Functions are for analysis:** They are perfect for tasks like "find the top N products per category" or "calculate month-over-month growth."
- **CTEs are for readability:** Use them to turn a monolithic, confusing query into a clean, step-by-step recipe.
- **Views are for reusability:** If you have a query you run often, save it as a `VIEW` to simplify future access.
