>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

## 📝 Daily Learning Log

### 📅 Week 1 (July 1-4, 2025)

<details>
<summary><strong> Day 4 - July 4th, 2025: User Input and Python Operators </strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Making programs interactive and performing operations [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01%20Foundation/01%20Notes/01%20My%20Notes/04%20User%20Input%20%26%20Operators.md).

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Static vs. Dynamic Values:**
  - **Static:** Hard-coded values in the program (e.g., `name = "Riyan"`).
  - **Dynamic:** Values provided by the user during runtime.
- **`input()` Function:**
  - Used to get dynamic input from the user.
  - **Crucial Rule:** It *always* returns a string.
- **Type Casting:**
  - The necessity of converting input strings to numbers using `int()` or `float()` for calculations.
- **Python Operators:**
  - **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulus), `**` (exponent).
  - **Assignment:** `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc., as shortcuts.
  - **Comparison:** `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` to get `True`/`False` results.
  - **Logical:** `and`, `or`, `not` to combine comparison results.
  - **Membership:** `in`, `not in` to check for presence in a sequence.
  - **Identity:** `is`, `is not` to check if two variables are the exact same object in memory.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Type casting is non-negotiable when getting numerical input from users.
- `is` and `==` are not the same; `==` checks for equal value, while `is` checks for identical memory location.
- Understanding the full range of operators is key to writing expressive and efficient Python code.

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Consolidate today's notes into a clean Jupyter Notebook.
- [ ] Practice the Bitwise operators homework to understand low-level data manipulation.
- [ ] Write a simple calculator program combining `input()`, type casting, and arithmetic operators.

<summary><strong>Day 3 - July 3rd, 2025: Python Fundamentals & Jupyter Mastery</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Hands-on coding and environment setup [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01%20Foundation/01%20Notes/01%20My%20Notes/03%20Python%20Fundamentals%20%26%20Jupyter%20Mastery.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Jupyter Notebook Navigation:**
  - Command Mode (blue border) vs Edit Mode (green border)
  - Essential shortcuts: `Shift + Enter` (run cell), `Esc` (command mode), `A` (insert above), `B` (insert below), `D,D` (delete cell)
  - Cell types: Code, Markdown, Raw
  
- **Markdown Documentation:**
  - Creating headers with `#`, `##`, `###`
  - Formatting text with **bold**, *italic*
  - Creating lists and links
  - Embedding images and structuring notes

- **Python Fundamentals:**
  - **Variable Naming Rules:**
    - Must start with letter or underscore `_`
    - Cannot start with numbers
    - No special characters except underscore
    - Case-sensitive (`name` ≠ `Name`)
  - **Basic Data Types:**
    - `int`: Integer numbers (e.g., `42`)
    - `float`: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`)
    - `str`: Text strings (e.g., `"Hello"`)
    - `bool`: True/False values
  - **Essential Functions:**
    - `print()`: Display output
    - `type()`: Check data type of variable

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Jupyter notebooks are perfect for combining code, documentation, and results in one place
- Good variable naming is crucial for code readability and maintenance
- Markdown makes notebook documentation clean and professional

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Set up `uv` environment for faster package management
- [x] Practice Jupyter shortcuts until they become muscle memory
- [ ] Create a Python basics cheat sheet for quick reference
