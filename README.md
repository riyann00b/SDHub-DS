>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

<summary><strong>Day 14 - July 19th, 2025 (Saturday Session): Advanced Functional Programming</strong></summary>

> **Note:** This was a special Saturday class to compensate for the holiday on Friday (July 18th), which was declared due to heavy rain.

**🎯 Session Focus:** Mastering flexible and powerful functional programming tools: `*args`, `**kwargs`, `lambda`, `map`, and `reduce`. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/14%20Functional%20Programming.md) | [Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/12%20functional%20programming.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

- **Flexible Function Arguments:**
    - **`*args`:** Understood how it captures a variable number of *positional* arguments into a **tuple**. This is perfect for functions that need to process an unknown number of items, like a custom `sum()` function.
    - **`**kwargs`:** Learned how it captures a variable number of *keyword* arguments into a **dictionary**, allowing for highly flexible functions that accept optional named attributes.
    - **Argument Order:** Mastered the mandatory function signature order: `standard_args`, `*args`, `**kwargs`.

- **`lambda` (Anonymous Functions):** Solidified the concept of `lambda` as a concise way to create small, one-line functions, especially useful inside other functions like `map` and `reduce`.
    - **Syntax:** `lambda arguments: expression`
    - **Conditional Logic:** Practiced the ternary syntax: `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`.

- **The `map` and `reduce` Functions:**
    - **`map(function, iterable)`:** Applies a function to *every* item in an iterable.
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            subgraph Input List
                A[1] --> B[2] --> C[3]
            end
            E((map: λ x: x*2))
            subgraph Output List
                F[2] --> G[4] --> H[6]
            end
            A --> E --> F; B --> E --> G; C --> E --> H;
        ```
    - **`reduce(function, iterable)`:** Cumulatively applies a function to a sequence to "reduce" it to a single value. (Requires import from `functools`).
        ```mermaid
        graph TD
            A[1] --> C{1 + 2 = 3};
            B[2] --> C;
            C --> E{3 + 3 = 6};
            D[3] --> E;
        ```

**💡 Key Insights:**
- `*args` and `**kwargs` are game-changers for creating professional, adaptable functions that don't force the user to provide a fixed set of inputs.
- The combination of `lambda` with `map` is an incredibly powerful and "Pythonic" pattern for data transformation, replacing clunky `for` loops.
- Finally understood the common errors from my previous notebooks—passing keyword arguments to a `*args`-only function was the main culprit. The distinction is now crystal clear.

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Created a new, clean Jupyter Notebook summarizing all the functional programming concepts.
- [x] Documented today's special session in my Markdown notes and this README.
- [ ] Write a function `create_report(student_name, *grades, **report_details)` that uses all three types of arguments to generate a formatted student report string.
- [ ] Revisit the `pass`/`fail` exercise and rewrite it as a single line using `map` and a `lambda` function.

<summary><strong>Day 13 - July 17th, 2025: Modularizing Code with Functional Programming</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Writing reusable, modular, and clean code using functions. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/13%20Functional%20Programming.md) | [Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/11%20Fuctional%20Programming.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

- **Functional Programming:** Introduced to the paradigm of building programs by defining and composing functions, promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding style.
- **User-Defined Functions:** Mastered the core mechanics of `def`, parameters vs. arguments, and the critical `return` keyword.
- **Variable Scope:** Differentiated between local and global scope.
- **Recursive Functions:** Explored the concept of a function that calls itself.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Functions are the most important building blocks for organized and scalable programs.
- Capturing a function's output with `return` is far more powerful than just printing it.

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 12 - July 16th, 2025: Pythonic Data Manipulation with Comprehensions</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Refactoring loops into elegant, one-line comprehensions for lists and dictionaries. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/12%20Loops%20and%20Comprehensions.md) | [Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/10%20Loop%20and%20comprehension.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Comprehensions:** Understood that comprehensions are a concise, "Pythonic" way to create lists, dictionaries, or sets.
- **Core Patterns:** Mastered simple mapping, filtering (`if` at the end), and conditional output (`if/else` at the beginning).

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Comprehensions are often more readable and can be faster than their equivalent `for` loop counterparts.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 11 - July 15th, 2025: Mastering Iteration with `for` Loops</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Using `for` loops to iterate over sequences and perform data manipulation.

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **The `for` Loop:** Understood its primary use for iterating over a known sequence.
- **`while` vs. `for` Loop:** Distinguished the use cases: `while` for unknown iteration counts, `for` for definite collections.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 10 - July 14th, 2025: Control Flow and `while` Loops</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Moving from sequential to iterative programming using `while` loops. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/10%20Control%20Flow%20with%20while%20%20Loops.md) | [Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/09%20While%20loop%20.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **The `while` Loop:** Mastered the three-step process: Initialization, Condition, and Update.
- **Loop Control Keywords:** Learned how `break`, `continue`, and `pass` alter the loop's flow.
