>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

<summary><strong>Day 19 - July 25th, 2025: File & Exception Handling: Making Programs Robust</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Building reliable programs by mastering File Handling (to persist data) and Exception Handling (to manage errors gracefully). [My Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/17%20OOP%20and%20File%20Handling.md) | [My Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Code%20JNs/JNB/15%20OOPs%20and%20file-handling.ipynb) | [Sir's Notebook](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/02_Python_Basics_Code/Sir's%20Jupyter%20NoteBooks/16%20File%20%26%20Exception%20handling.ipynb)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

Today, we learned how to make our programs interact with the file system and how to stop them from crashing when things go wrong. These two concepts are foundational for any real-world application.

### 📂 1. File Handling

This is the process of creating, reading, updating, and deleting files using Python.

**File Modes:** The `open()` function requires a 'mode' to know what we plan to do.

| Mode | Name | Description |
|:----:|:---|:---|
| `'r'` | **Read** | Opens a file for reading. **Raises an error** if the file does not exist. (Default) |
| `'w'` | **Write** | Opens a file for writing. **Creates the file** if it does not exist, and **overwrites the content** if it does. |
| `'a'` | **Append** | Opens a file for appending. **Creates the file** if it does not exist and **adds new content to the end**. |
| `r+` | Read+ | Opens for both reading and writing. |

**The `with` Statement (Context Manager):** This is the **best practice** for working with files. It ensures the file is automatically closed, even if errors occur.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B(Open file using with open)
    B --> C{Perform operations: read write etc}
    C --> D[Automatically leave the with block]
    D --> E(File is safely closed!)
    C -->|Exception Occurs!| D
```

### 🛡️ 2. Exception Handling

This is how we manage errors that happen while our program is running. It prevents the program from crashing and allows us to respond to errors in a controlled way.

**The `try...except` Block:** We put risky code in the `try` block. If an error occurs, the code in the `except` block is executed.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Try Block};
    B -- No Exception --> C[Execute Code in Try];
    C --> F[Continue Program];
    B -- Exception Occurs --> D{Matching Except Block?};
    D -- Yes --> E[Execute Code in Except];
    E --> F;
    D -- No --> G[❌ Program Crashes];
```
*Example: Handling bad user input.*
```python
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
```

**The `try...except...finally` Block:** The `finally` block **always executes**, no matter what. It's perfect for cleanup tasks, like closing files.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Execution Flow"
        A[Start] --> B{Try Block};
        B -- No Exception --> C[Execute Try Code];
        B -- Exception Occurs --> D[Execute Except Code];
        C --> E{Finally Block};
        D --> E;
        E --> F[Execute Finally Code];
        F --> G[End];
    end
```
*Example: Reading a file robustly.*
```python
try:
    with open('data.txt', 'r') as file:
        print(file.read())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'data.txt' was not found.")
finally:
    print("--> File handling finished.")
```

**💡 Key Insights:**
- **Synergy is Key:** File Handling and Exception Handling go hand-in-hand. You should rarely write file I/O code without wrapping it in a `try...except` block to handle potential errors like `FileNotFoundError`.
- **Building Reliability:** These concepts are the bedrock of reliable software. Before we can even think about analyzing data with Pandas, we must be able to load it from a CSV or text file without our program crashing if the file is missing or corrupted.
- **From Theory to Practice:** Combining OOP with these skills is powerful. An object can now have methods like `.save_state()` and `.load_state()` that use `try...except` blocks to safely write and read their own data to a file.

<summary><strong>Day 15 - July 21st, 2025: Loops & List Comprehension: Mastering Iteration</strong></summary>
    
**🎯 Session Focus:** Mastering iterative tasks with `while` and `for` loops, and learning to write elegant, efficient, and Pythonic code using List Comprehensions. [My Practice Notebook](link-to-your-notebook) | [Sir's Notebook](link-to-sir's-notebook)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**

### 🔁 1. While Loops
A `while` loop repeatedly executes a code block as long as a specified condition remains `True`. It's ideal for situations where you don't know the exact number of iterations beforehand.

**Flowchart:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Condition?};
    B -- True --> C[Execute Code Block];
    C --> B;
    B -- False --> D[End];
```
*Example: Reversing a number.*
```python
number = 123
reversed_num = 0
while number > 0:
    digit = number % 10
    reversed_num = (reversed_num * 10) + digit
    number //= 10
print(f"Reversed number is: {reversed_num}") # Output: 321
```
    
### 🔂 2. For Loops
A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a code block for each item. It's perfect for when you need to process every item in a collection.

**Flowchart:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{For each item in sequence};
    B -- More items --> C[Execute Code Block];
    C --> B;
    B -- No more items --> D[End];
```
*Example: Finding prime numbers in a range.*
```python
for num in range(10, 51):
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            if (num % i) == 0:
                break
        else: # This 'else' belongs to the 'for' loop
            print(num)
```

### 🧠 3. List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise and readable way to create lists. They are often more efficient than using a `for` loop and `.append()`.

**Structure Breakdown:**
`new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]`

| Part | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `expression` | The value to include in the new list. | `x**2` |
| `for item in iterable` | The loop over the source sequence. | `for x in range(1, 11)` |
| `if condition` | (Optional) A filter to include only certain items. | `if x % 2 == 0`|

*Example: Create a list of Fahrenheit temperatures from Celsius.*```python
celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
fahrenheit = [(c * 9/5) + 32 for c in celsius]
print(fahrenheit) # Output: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]

**💡 Key Insights:**
- **Right Tool for the Job:** Use `while` loops for condition-based iteration and `for` loops for sequence-based iteration.
- **Pythonic Elegance:** List comprehensions are not just syntactic sugar; they are a hallmark of clean, readable, and efficient Python code. Mastering them is a key step towards writing professional-grade scripts.
- **Foundation for Data Science:** Iteration is fundamental. We will use these loop concepts constantly to process rows in a dataset, manipulate lists of features, and train machine learning models.

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Update README with this new entry and fix date ordering.
- [ ] Create a list of the first 20 Fibonacci numbers using a `while` loop.
- [ ] Write a script that finds common elements between two lists using a nested `for` loop.
- [ ] Re-write the script from the previous point using a list comprehension for a more concise solution.
- [ ] Use a list comprehension to create a list of all consonant characters from a given sentence.
