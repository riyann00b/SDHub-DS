>     💡 A Note on Folder Visibility:
> The structure above shows the complete, intended layout of my repository. However, Git does not track empty directories. Therefore, some folders (like Projects/ or future phase folders) may not be visible on GitHub until I add the first file (e.g., a notebook, a note, or a placeholder .gitkeep file) to them. They will appear automatically as my journey progresses and I populate them with content!

## 📝 Daily Learning Log

<details open>
<summary><strong>📅 Week 2 (July 7th Onwards)</strong></summary>

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 8 & 9 - July 10-11, 2025: Conditional Programming Mastery</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Building complex decision-making logic in Python. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/08_Conditional_Programming_Mastery.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **`if-elif-else` Chains:** Mastered the flow for handling multiple, mutually exclusive conditions, as seen in the student grading problem.
- **Nested `if` Statements:** Understood how to create decisions within decisions, a concept solidified by the password and user verification exercises. The logic flows from a parent condition to a child condition.
- **The `in` Operator:** Used this powerful keyword to check for membership within a list (`if name in user_list:`), making code cleaner and more readable.
- **Ternary Operator:** Practiced the concise one-line `if-else` syntax (`value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`) for simple assignments like calculating square vs. cube.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Nested conditions are the key to building programs that react to a sequence of user inputs.
- The ternary operator is elegant for simple choices but should be avoided for complex logic to maintain readability.
- Combining operators like `in` with conditional statements is a very "Pythonic" way to write code.

**🎯 Personal Action Items:**
- [x] Completed and documented all conditional programming exercises from the notebooks.
- [x] Created a comprehensive study guide for this week's topics.
- [ ] Begin preliminary reading on `for` and `while` loops to prepare for next week.

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 7 - July 9th, 2025: Sets and Dictionaries</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Understanding and implementing Python's powerful key-value and unique-item collections. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/07_Sets_and_Dictionaries.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Sets:**
  - **Definition:** Unordered collections with **no duplicate elements**.
  - **Creation:** Using `{}` or the `set()` constructor.
  - **Operations:** Mastered `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.union()`, `.intersection()`, and `.difference()`.
- **Dictionaries:**
  - **Definition:** Ordered (in Python 3.7+) collections of **key-value pairs**.
  - **Rules:** Keys must be immutable and unique. Values can be anything.
  - **CRUD Operations:** Practiced Creating (adding a new key), Reading (accessing a value), Updating (changing a value), and Deleting (`.pop()`) key-value pairs.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Sets are incredibly efficient for removing duplicates from a list (`list(set(my_list))`).
- The `TypeError` when trying to modify a tuple inside a dictionary was a critical lesson: a collection's mutability is distinct from the mutability of its contents.
- Dictionaries are the foundation for more complex data structures like JSON, making them extremely important.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 6 - July 8th, 2025: Lists and Tuples</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Deep dive into Python's sequence data types. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/06_Lists_and_Tuples.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Lists:**
  - **Definition:** Ordered, **mutable** (changeable) collections.
  - **Operations:** Practiced `.append()` to add items and `.pop()` to remove them.
- **Tuples:**
  - **Definition:** Ordered, **immutable** (unchangeable) collections.
  - **Immutability in Action:** Understood that to "add" an element, you must create a new tuple by concatenating the old one with a new one. `tup = tup + (new_item,)`.
- **Indexing and Slicing:** Reinforced the `[start:stop:step]` syntax for both lists and tuples to access sub-sequences.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The choice between a list and a tuple depends entirely on whether you need to modify the data after creation.
- The trailing comma in `(item,)` is crucial for defining a single-element tuple.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 5 - July 7th, 2025: Introduction to Python Strings</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Revising operators and a deep dive into string manipulation. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01_Foundation/01_Notes/01_My_Notes/05_Python_Strings.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **String Definition:** An immutable (unchangeable) sequence of characters.
- **String Creation:** Using single (`'...'`), double (`"..."`), or triple (`'''...'''`) quotes.
- **String Access:**
  - **Indexing:** Grabbing a single character using its position (e.g., `my_name[0]` for the first, `my_name[-1]` for the last).
  - **Slicing:** Extracting a substring using a `[start:end:step]` format.
- **Warm-up Practice:** Solved problems involving type casting and arithmetic operators to solidify previous concepts.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- The immutability of strings is a key concept. To "change" a string, you must create a new one.
- Slicing, especially with `[::-1]` to reverse a string, is a powerful and concise feature of Python.
- Negative indexing is extremely convenient for accessing items from the end of a sequence without needing to know its length.

<summary><strong>📅 Week 1 (July 1-4, 2025)</strong></summary>

<br>

<details>
<summary><strong> Day 4 - July 4th, 2025: User Input and Python Operators </strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Making programs interactive and performing operations. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01%20Foundation/01%20Notes/01%20My%20Notes/04%20User%20Input%20%26%20Operators.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Static vs. Dynamic Values:**
  - **Static:** Hard-coded values in the program.
  - **Dynamic:** Values provided by the user during runtime.
- **`input()` Function:**
  - Used to get dynamic input, always returns a string.
- **Type Casting:**
  - The necessity of converting input strings to numbers using `int()` or `float()`.
- **Python Operators:**
  - Covered the full suite: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Membership, and Identity.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Type casting is non-negotiable when getting numerical input.
- `is` and `==` are not the same; `==` checks value, while `is` checks memory location.

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 3 - July 3rd, 2025: Python Fundamentals & Jupyter Mastery</strong></summary>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Hands-on coding and environment setup. [Notes](https://github.com/riyann00b/SDHub-DS/blob/main/SDHub-DS/01%20Foundation/01%20Notes/01%20My%20Notes/03%20Python%20Fundamentals%20%26%20Jupyter%20Mastery.md)

**📚 Key Concepts Learned:**
- **Jupyter Notebook Navigation:** Command Mode vs. Edit Mode and essential shortcuts.
- **Markdown Documentation:** Basics of formatting text and structuring notes.
- **Python Fundamentals:** Variable naming rules and basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).

**💡 Key Insights:**
- Good variable naming is crucial for code readability.
- Jupyter notebooks are perfect for combining code, documentation, and results.
