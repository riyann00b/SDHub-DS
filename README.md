**🎯 Currently Learning: Week 9 - Power BI: Data Modeling & DAX**
- We are deep into Power BI, having covered the Power Query Editor and are now focusing on creating relationships between different data tables (Data Modeling).
- **Up Next:** Advanced DAX, SQL for Data Analysis.

## 📝 Today's Learning Overview (September 2nd, 2025)

<details open>
<summary><strong>Day 64 - Power BI: Mastering Data Modeling & Relationships</strong></summary>
<br>

**🎯 Session Focus:** Building a robust and efficient data model by creating and configuring relationships between tables. This is the backbone of any meaningful Power BI report.

**📚 Key Concepts Explored:**

Today we moved from cleaning individual tables in the Power Query Editor to connecting them in the **Model View**. A well-structured model is essential for accurate and fast analysis.

### 🔗 1. Understanding Relationships & Cardinality
We learned that relationships define how different tables filter each other. The key concept was **cardinality**, which describes the uniqueness of values in a column.
- **One-to-Many (`1:*`):** The most common type (e.g., one *Product* can have many *Sales*).
- **One-to-One (`1:1`):** Less common (e.g., one *Employee* has one set of *Contact Info*).
- **Many-to-Many (`*.*`):** Complex relationship that often requires a "bridge" table.

### ↔️ 2. Filter Direction
We explored how filters flow between tables. Setting the correct **cross-filter direction** (Single or Both) is crucial for creating interactive reports where selecting an item in one visual correctly filters another.

### Schema Design: Star vs. Snowflake
- **Star Schema:** The preferred model. A central "Fact" table (like *Sales*) is connected to multiple "Dimension" tables (like *Products*, *Customers*, *Dates*). It's simple and efficient.
- **Snowflake Schema:** A more normalized version where dimension tables are broken down into further tables.

**💡 Key Insights:**
- **A Good Model is Everything:** You can be a DAX wizard, but your formulas will be slow and incorrect if the underlying data model and relationships are poorly designed.
- **Think in Terms of Facts and Dimensions:** Separating your data into tables that describe *what happened* (facts) and tables that describe the *who, what, where, when* (dimensions) is the foundation of good BI design.
- **Avoid Many-to-Many When Possible:** While Power BI supports many-to-many relationships, they can introduce ambiguity. The best practice is often to create a bridge table to resolve them into two one-to-many relationships.
