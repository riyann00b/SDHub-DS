## 📝 Daily Learning Log

### Day 3 - July 3rd, 2025: Hands-on with Jupyter & Python Fundamentals
-   **Summary:** Today was a major step forward! I moved from theory to practice by setting up my environment, getting hands-on with Jupyter Notebook, and writing my first lines of Python code. This session was all about building a solid foundation for the work ahead.
-   **Key Concepts Learned:**
    -   **Jupyter Notebook Mastery:** Learned the difference between **Command Mode** (blue border, for notebook-level actions) and **Edit Mode** (green border, for typing in cells). Practiced essential shortcuts like `Shift + Enter`, `Esc`, `A`, `B`, and `D,D`.
    -   **Markdown for Documentation:** Got comfortable using Markdown to format text, create headings, lists, and add links/images directly in my notebook.
    -   **Python's First Steps:**
        -   **Variables & Identifiers:** Understood the rules for naming variables (must start with a letter or `_`, no special characters, case-sensitive).
        -   **Basic Data Types:** Learned about `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
        -   **Core Functions:** Used `print()` to display output and `type()` to check the data type of my variables.
-   **Action Items:**
    -   Organize today's notes into a clean Jupyter Notebook.
    -   Practice the variable declaration and `print()` syntax.
    -   Experiment with more Jupyter shortcuts to improve my workflow.

### Day 2 - July 2nd, 2025: Diving into AI, ML, & DL
-   **Summary:** Covered the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. We explored the applications of Generative AI and the historical context of the field.
-   **Key Concepts Learned:** AI vs. ML vs. DL, Generative AI applications, historical context of Alan Turing, and key terminology like NLP and LLMs.

### Day 1 - July 1st, 2025: Course Orientation & The World of Data
-   **Summary:** The official start! We received a comprehensive overview of the Data Science field, the course structure, and career opportunities.
-   **Key Concepts Learned:** Data Science vs. Data Analysis, the roles of descriptive and inferential statistics.
