## What is Data Science?

**Definition**: Data Science is simply the **study of data**.

### Data Science vs Data Analysis

#### Data Science

- **Focus**: Predicting the future using AI/ML
- **Statistics Used**: Inferential Statistics
- **Purpose**: Make predictions and forecasts
- **Example**: "How many students will join SDHub in the future?"

#### Data Analysis

- **Focus**: Taking insights from the past (historical events)
- **Statistics Used**: Descriptive Statistics
- **Purpose**: Categorize and describe existing data
- **Example**: "How many girls vs boys are in SDHub? What's the average age of students?"
