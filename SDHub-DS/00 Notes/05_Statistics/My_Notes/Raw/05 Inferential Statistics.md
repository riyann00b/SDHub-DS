inferring about population using sample 

sampling techniques
1. convineus -> last 10 or first 10 records
2. systematic ->  
3. stratified -> group then select
4. random ->  any record


avg and standardisation 

point estimation
1. mean 
2. std
---
1. single sample = mean and std of a sample a approx to population
2. multiple sample (data is abnormal)
	1. CLT = population (sample 1,2,3) meu 1 +2 + 3 / 3
	2. we use CLT to normalize data
	3. mean of sample and std of sample

---
value at interval (CL) / Class interval

# confidence Interval

Range ( min / max)

95% of data lies within this range =  [20 - 25]  -> mean range

margin of error (MOE) = z-score * standard error

$$ 
z- score = x^1 - meo / sigma
$$
 
standard error =  sigma / root n

sigma = std
n = np of record
x1 = data point
meo = mean


$$
CI = [meo +- 2 * SE]
$$

alpha value

domain expert will provide value

1.  One tailed test : sigma / 2
2. Two tailed test : sigma

### hypothesis
### CI will allow us to formulate an assumption (hypothesis)

### Also, hypothesis (assumption) is given

1. H0 : Null Hypothesis
2. H1 (Ha): Alternode hypothesis

---
null hypothesis = no relation no change no difference

---

H0 average salary of DA = 5 LPA -> 1 tailed
H0 average salary of DA != 5 LPA 
1. != : two tailde
2. > : one tailed
3. < : one tailed

if h0 is true the h1 is false 


P VALUE = probability of true or false (errors)


Two type of error can occur:
1. Type 1 : H0 = true,
2. Type 2: false
