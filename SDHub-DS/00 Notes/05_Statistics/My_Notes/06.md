1. descriptive statistics
2. inferential statistics

probability

experiment 1 : possible of 1 event ->  mutually exclusive  

experiment 2 : possible of multiple event (multiplicative rule) -> non mutually exclusive  

probability

barnoly distribution 

binomial distribution

poison distribution -> pmf , pdf, pmo

promability mass function

probabilty desity fuction

cdf -> cumulative destribution function

combination permutation

inferential statistics

population -> entire data

selection data mean tech

sytamatics 

statisfy

random

infer using a sample

point estimation possible when data is normal

point estimation using single sample

if not normal -> multiple sample

final mean / STD

central limit theorem = do not create 

approx = 

---

range =  confidence interval in minimum and maximum value


mean -= margin of error

z-score , z-test, p-test 

MoE
STD = z-test 
no STD =  p-test

MoE
 z - test * SE
 p - test * SE

the avg age of sdhub student is 23 (hypothesis)

null hypothesis = innocent until proven guilty

---

type 1 / 2 error

significance level and p values



---
table of use-case
analysis of variance = ANOVA 

t -test

z - score = data sprendness

varience formalu =  data point - meu

z - socre formula = x1 - meu of sample / std

pmf cdf pdf

pdf = propability distribution function = 3 fucntion (major term pmf, pdf, cdf)
vs
pdf = probabity density fuction = continouse probabality
