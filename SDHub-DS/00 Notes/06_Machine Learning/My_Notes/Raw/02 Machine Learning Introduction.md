Machine Learning: Making machines to learn from data
![](https://iq.opengenus.org/content/images/2022/05/data-science-related-domains.png)

A Concepts which says machines can also have the ability to think (1950-52)

explain full story:

Allen Turing and world war 2 and anegma code story (the imitation game docter strange)

Turing machine 

main brake through 1960 

first AI application Eliza 
it was basic application (pattern based ) 

brake through 1980s IBM check bot defeated human

1980 - 1990s internets which help Machine learing

2011 -> Deep learning

2017 -> NLP / GenAI

(make a time line)

---

80% - 90% interview questions will be on Machine learing

### Machine learning: 
Example: teaching kids like explain with example
weather forecasting 

#### Data : 

to build a weather forecasting  model we need Data

like temp humidity ,trends ,pattern

this will help to pred if its reining or sunny

gender deteching :
data like hight and weight hair face 

Machine learning drabacks
1. data dependent
2. large weight

to takle this we developed 

### Deep learning

DL -> learning in depth / traing in depth
gender deteching : inaddtion to weight and height we also include skin tone etc

computer brain : neural networks


### Natural Language Processing (NPL)

communicating with machine in natural language

NPL is a technique which can convert machine language to human natural language 

it can process natural language and acts like a translator

Sequnce 

Ai -> ML -> DL -> NLP -> Model (LLM) -> Prediction application / Gen AI Models -> AI Workflow -> Agentic AI -> MCP server  (Model Context Protocol)

(Ai workflow in action is called Agentic AI which give rise to MCP)
researcher  -> developers  -> data scientist

# LLM

llm is noting but engine and body is UI 

API's -> give access to LLM's

# Machine Learning (ML) 

Types of ML
1. Supervised
2. un-supervised
3. reinforcement

supurvice: uses lable data / output known example: email spam detections high use (80%)

unsupervised: uses unlabled data / unknown output : example: 
Recommendation engine / system (behaiver recognistion)  (15%)

reinforcement: hit and try  /learn from the environment using panality and usecase Robotics reward example: tasla robots | low use / high cost (5%) 

Supervised vs unsupervised vs reinforcement

| Supervised | unsupervised | reinforcement |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- |
|            |              |               |

explain use cases for each of them with example

Reggaration and classification


1. Supervised ML -> output in known and data is labelled e.g: 

Known output: 
1. categorical (Discrete) -> classification Model example: Spam detector
2. Numeric (Continuous) -> Regression Model example: temperature forecasting

---
2. Unsupervised ML:  Output is unknown / Unlabelled data e.g: recommendation engine
	type:
		1. clustering -> it is like Grouping data e.g: recommendation engine 
		2. dimensionalty reduction (Features / Fields / ***columns***) -> reducing number of features earlier we used co-relation

# Deep learning (DL)

Types
1. NLP (Natural Language Processing) -> Text baed (chatgpt)
2. CV (Computer Vision) -> image and video based  (helmet detector in traffic sigles)
