    "### 1. Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a key principle of data hiding.\n\n",
    "In Python, we use **access modifiers** to control the visibility of attributes and methods. These are denoted by naming conventions:\n",
    "- **`Public`**: Accessible from anywhere. (e.g., `name`)\n",
    "- **`Protected`**: Should only be accessed within the class and its subclasses. Denoted by a single underscore prefix. (e.g., `_age`). *Note: This is a convention; Python does not enforce it.*\n",
    "- **`Private`**: Should only be accessed within the class. Denoted by a double underscore prefix. (e.g., `__salary`). Python enforces this through a process called **name mangling**."
